# calculator

A calculator project where the user can input numbers and receive a result. You can click the buttons or you can input numbers using your keyboard.

The user can select different operators.

- Modulo %
- Divide /
- Multiply \*
- Subtract -
- Addition +

There is a +- button that once clicked, the next inputted number will be a _negative_ number.
You can string operators together, for example;

`6 * 3 + 5 = 23`

## How it went:

Over all I found this project relatively straight forward. There were some tricky bits with displaying the correct sequence of numbers and the logic behind stringing operators, but sorted relatively quickly. For the keyboard support I opted to simulate the button clicks when a key was pressed, I found this to be simple and effect whilst working with all my previously created functions, however I'm not too please with the amount of if() statements. May come back in the future if I find a cleaner solution.
